# Artifactory RPM Installation playbook
# ==========================
# Artifactory can also be installed from an RPM or Debian distribution on Red Hat compatible Linux distributions.
# The installation package creates a dedicated user, installs a stripped-down distribution of the Apache Tomcat container configured for Artifactory (on port 8081), and registers this Tomcat as a service (but does not start it immediately).
# Iteration 1 - (done) get ansible working and install artifactory RPM and dependencies.
#           2 - (todo) modify configuration files to use mysql server.
#           3 - (todo) modify configuration files to use attach storage.

# MySQL
# Assumes RDS already created. Default is Derby Storage, and this works out of the box.
# 1. Copy $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/misc/db/mysql.properties to $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/storage.properties
# (If you do not have this file you can take it from the standalone zip distribution or directly from the JFrog domain). For a full explanation on the contents of this file please refer to The Bundled Storage Configurations.
#
# 2. Adjust the connection definitions in the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/storage.properties file to match the attributes of the Artifactory database you created.
# You must configure the database URL and username/password to use. The schema and tables are created first time Artifactory is run using the new database.
#
# 3. Download the MySQL JDBC driver (available from the  MySQL website)  and copy the mysql-connector-java-<version>.jar file into the server's shared lib directory.
#For example $TOMCAT_HOME/lib when installed as a service or $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/tomcat/lib in the standalone version.

# Attach EBS Storage
# Assumes EBS already created.
# Default is local storage, and this works out of the box.
