# Artifactory RPM Installation playbook
# ==========================
# Artifactory can also be installed from an RPM or Debian distribution on Red Hat compatible Linux distributions.
# The installation package creates a dedicated user, installs a stripped-down distribution of the Apache Tomcat container configured for Artifactory (on port 8081), and registers this Tomcat as a service (but does not start it immediately).
# Iteration 1 - get ansible working and install artifactory RPM.
#           2 - modify configuration files to use mysql server.
#           3 - modify configuration files to use attach storage.
